# Decoder-Project
This is my Decoder Project for Module 12 at Thinkful


For this project, I had to create three ciphers.

The first cipher is a Caesar shift cipher where you provide a string of text and the shift value.
On the encode, the text will return as a shifted text.
On a decode, it will return as a readable word or phrase.

The second cipher is a Polybius cipher.  This uses a grid to encode and decode a phrase.
On the encode, it will convert a phrase or word into a series of numbers.
On the decode, it will convert the series of numbers into a word or phrase.

The third cipher is a Substitution cipher where you provide the input and a cipher.
